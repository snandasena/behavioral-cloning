Behavioral Cloning Project
---

### Introduction
The goal of the project is to build a ML model to simulate a car to run in a autonomus mode that is provided by Udacity. The simulator can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). The deep neural network will be used to build this model primalary Convolutional Neuaral Network(CNN) will be implemented by using [NVIDIA End-to-End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars architecture](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/).
