Behavioral Cloning Project
---

### Introduction
The goal of the project is to build a ML model to simulate a car to run in a autonomus mode that is provided by Udacity. The simulator can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). The deep neural network will be used to build this model primalary Convolutional Neuaral Network(CNN) will be implemented by using [NVIDIA End-to-End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars architecture](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/). There are two provided lane tracks to generate training data for this project and this project requirement is to build a model for first track. To continue this project successfuly following steps were proccessed.

* Data Preprocessing
* Image Data Aumentation
* Traning Data Preparation
* Building the Model Architecture
* Training the Model
* Testing with Simulator

### Data Preprocessing
To undestand about these simulator generated data I used a 'Jupyter Notebook](image_utils.ipynb) and did some preliminary data precessing steps.  
**Note: This Jupyter file is not covering all the steps I was followed and it was used to start image preprocessing.**
